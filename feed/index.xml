<p>A lot of people I work with struggle to dive into their meaningful work because they get stopped up by beliefs they have about finding a purpose.</p>



<p>I can’t find my purpose because I don’t have the time, I am not good enough, I don’t have any clarity, I’m not ready, I don’t have the money to create it powerfully.</p>



<p>Anything that’s stopping us are myths! They are beliefs we’ve created that are getting in our way.</p>



<p>What I’ve found powerful is admitting to ourselves that we want a purpose, a mission, something meaningful in our lives.</p>



<p>What I’ve found powerful is taking ownership of creating that, moving all the false beliefs out of the way so that we can finally have what we truly desire.</p>



<p>I’m going to conduct a free training this Sunday (May 30) on this:</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEtfuisrj0qGdLPkhIffMPrtS0vTLZqf-d0">Free Training: 5 Myths About Finding Purpose &amp; a Method for Creating Purpose</a></strong></p>



<p>The training starts at 9am Pacific / 12pm ET / 8pm London on Sunday (May 30), please register above if you’re interested. I will send out a recording to those who register.</p>



<p>In this training, I will share:</p>



<ul><li>The 5 myths about finding purpose &amp; why they’re wrong</li><li>New empowering beliefs that you can use to replace these false beliefs</li><li>A simple method for creating purpose in your life</li><li>How to practice with this method</li></ul>



<p>If you find the training to be powerful, I will also invite some of you to stay for an extra 30-minute coaching session around your purpose.</p>



<p>I hope to see you soon!</p>
